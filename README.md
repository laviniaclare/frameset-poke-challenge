This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the main page. You can click on the name of a pokemon to see it's detail page.

This was created using the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)

# Future Improvements
This is a very simple interface with pretty boring funcionality. Some things that I think would make it better/more fun are:
- A search function
- Pagination on the front page
- Sorting and filtering functionality on the front page. It would be nice to be able to sort them aphabetically, or filter by type, for example.
- The pokemon detail page could have links to other evolutions
- It would be nice to be able to click on a move on the pokemon detail page and see other pokemon that can learn that move, and pokemon who are weak to that move
- This could be built out to have landing and detail pages for other things, like berries and locations. Perhaps the front page could have tabs for each category of things instead of one static list
